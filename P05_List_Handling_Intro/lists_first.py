# Create a program called lists_first that creates a list of six integers.
# The list contains the following values:  1, 5, 4, 6, 2, and 7. The program should print the list on a single line as
# shown in the example output. Note: Of course, you can use a loop in your program. But in Python, you can also print the whole
#  list as required by calling the print function once.
#  Please see in the course material how to format output when we are printing a list.

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 7]
print(*my_list)
