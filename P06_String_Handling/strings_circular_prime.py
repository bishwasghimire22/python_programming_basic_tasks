# (This is an optional grade level 5+ exercise)
# Create a program called strings_circular_prime that has the following three functions: main, is_prime, and is_circular_prime.
# The is_prime function takes an integer as argument and returns True if the integer is a prime number.
# Otherwise, the function should return False. The function should not input anything from the user or print anything.
# The is_circular_prime function takes an integer as argument and returns True if the integer is a circular prime number.
# Otherwise, the function should return False. The function should not input anything from the user or print anything.
# A prime number (prime) is an integer greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
# A circular prime number is a prime number that remains prime on any cyclic rotation of its digits in base 10. For example,
# 113 is a circular prime because 113, 131, and 311 are primes.
# 41 is a prime but is not a circular prime because its circular rotation 14 is not a prime.
# The main function should first ask the user to enter a positive integer.
#  Then the main function should print the integer and either the text "is a circular prime" or "is not a circular prime".
# The main function should call the is_circular_prime function to determine if a number is a circular prime or not.
