# Create a program called functions_double_factorials. The program should have a function called double_factorial
#  that takes an integer as argument and returns the double factorial of the integer.
# See the previous "Double Factorial" exercise for more details.
#  The double_factorial function should not print anything.
# The main function should print double factorials of 0 â€“ 9 as shown in the example output.
#  To determine the double factorial of each number, the main function should call the double_factorial function.
#  Please use the for loop in the main function.
