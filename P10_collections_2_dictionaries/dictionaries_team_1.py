# Create a program called dictionaries_team_1. The program should first create a dictionary that holds each team member's name (as the key) and role in the team (as the value).
# Then the program should print the dictionary as shown in the example output.
#  The team members are the following:
# John    software developer
# Ann     project manager
# Susan   software developer
# Jill    lead developer

my_team = {
    "John": "software developer",
    "Ann": "project manager",
    "Susan": "software developer",
    "Jill": "lead developer",
}

print(my_team)
